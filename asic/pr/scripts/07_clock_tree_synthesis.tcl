# Note:
# - "Trunk" - refers to the wire and buffers not connected to DFFs' inputs
# - "Leaf" - refers to wires connect to the DFFs' inputs, and DFFs' themself
#
# TODO: After running the script, check in the reports:
# 1. How many clock buffers were used.
# 2. Check what is the Worst Rising/Falling Trunk/Leaf Slew. Are the values
# within the requirements?
# 3. Are there any other violations?
# TODO: Open "Clock Tree Debugger" and make a screenshot of the clock tree structure.
