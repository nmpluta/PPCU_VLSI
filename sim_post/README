Recommended simulation strategy:

1. Simulations without timing checks and with debug (for simulation debug, the
fastest):

./run_post -m ASIC -n -d 

2. Simulations with timing checks (for implementation verfication) for minimum
and maximum delays

./run_post -m ASIC -y MAX
./run_post -m ASIC -y MIN

3. Simulations without timing checks and with TCF dump (very slow).

./run_post -m ASIC -n -t
